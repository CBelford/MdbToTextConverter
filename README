Utility that will take a single MS Access .mdb, or all files in a directory, and output the .mdb's table contents in a variety of formats.

When porting a legacy application from VB6 to C#, one piece of functionality that needed to be tested was that generated Microsoft Access .mdb files between the old/new code were the same.

These files were used as the data source for generated Crystal reports.  Testing of the .mdb output was relegated to merely "staring-and-comparing" between the report from the old system and the report from the new system.

This utility automates the generation of .txt or .xml files from generated .mdbs, allowing testers to compare the text files using their favorite diff tool.
